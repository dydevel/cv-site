          Blackcat was an agile software development consultancy, serving both large and small organisations, providing expert software delivery teams producing cutting edge custom technology solutions. 
          I was involved in numerous and varied projects.
          
          Blackcat ceased trading January 2021.   
                    
          **Project - Elsevier - Open Access (4 months)**
          
          I joined an existing scrum team on a long running project involving the development of several key public facing web applications. I worked on the development of new application features including updating the existing UI flows, replacing legacy code and integration involving Elsevierâ€™s internal payment and invoicing systems. I worked closely with product owners and technical leads to drive improvements to customer user journeys and expand available payment options driving an increase in market share in the Chinese market. I left the project as Blackcat ended its operations, and was immediately hired in a permanent tech lead role in another division of the business.

          **Project - Proagrica MDM (8 months)**
          
          Myself and a small team of Blackcat consultants started a greenfield project tasked with designing a taxonomy and data lake for storing CRM and product catalogue data. I was primarily involved in the UX design and development of a new single page web application for identifying and maintaining links between similar customer products. I was also responsible for developing REST APIs providing the application data layer for the data lake. This project provided a strong foundation for future data lake backed services providing potentially transformational new business capabilities.

          **Project - Elsevier PPE (18 months)**
          
          I was the technical lead of a large scrum team assigned with the task of developing a UI and associated services for compiling articles into journals - the first part of a programme of work to modernise the systems involved in journal production. The solution introduced a new microservice architecture and a new React based single page web application. Deployment was via a new continuous delivery pipeline - a first for Elsevier. I worked closely with the product owner and solution architect to lead the design of the technical solution. The foundational work we produced for this project has provided the foundation for several further projects, and has significantly reduced the burden of journal issue compilation for journal managers, reducing time to publication and providing significant cost savings for Elsevier.

          **Project - Informed 360 (6 months)**
             
          I was a member of a small scrum team delivering an innovative compliance web application product for a small startup. I was involved in developing new functionality for user stories, optimisation of AWS deployment infrastructure and development of the CI/CD pipeline.
          <p class="quote">Java 8, Spring Boot, ReactJs, Redux, Terraform, Docker, AWS</p>   
          
          **Project - Deb Group (9 months)**
 
          I was taken on to support a lone internal developer in completing, improving and productionising an Internet-Of-Things Spring Boot backed dashboard web application. My work included web application development - implementing dashboard widgets & charting, the dockerization & deployment of the application in the cloud and also the development of a CI pipeline
          <p class="quote">Java 8, Spring Boot, Backbone JS, D3.js, Docker, AWS</p>
          
          **Project - Thomson Reuters - Regulatory Intelligence (2 years, 10 months)**
  
          Initially Joined a scrum team working to add new features to a single page web application written in Java and Dojo UI.
          * Became Scrum Master / Tech Lead a Team working on XSLT document transformations.
          * Designed and Implemented a solution for on-the-fly pagination of large XML documents.
          * Designed and built a test data generation framework

      Iâ€™m a husband and hands on Dad to a Son and Daughter aged 11 and 6 respectively. 
      When not ferrying children to clubs and lessons, I enjoy playing guitar, and generally enjoy all things guitar related. 
      I have an interest in motorsports and cars in general.  Iâ€™m often found up a ladder â€˜DIY-ingâ€™ at the weekend.  
      I enjoy exercising - Iâ€™m a regular at the gym, plus I jog and cycle when time and weather allow.
